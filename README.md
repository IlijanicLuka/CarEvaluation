# Car Evaluation

## Overview
- Using car evaluation dataset for training and testing popular machine learning algorithms
- Based on the conclusions reached from the statistical analysis begins learning and testing of classification algorithms
- Each algorithm tries to achieve the best possible solution through an iterative process, while their quality is tested
based on the results of particular metrics (accuracy, precision, ROC AUC score,...)
- Achieving stable performance evaluation of particular model applying the 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation
- Combining models using ensemble method
